## Portfolio by Matias Kari

This is a simple portfolio website made to showcase my different projects I've made. I wanted to make another project for my portfolio
and what better project to showcase than the portfolio itself! I also wanted to do a small project to see how my recently obtained React.js skills were.

## Technologies

This portfolio site is made with React.js and uses the React-router-dom library for navigation between pages.
